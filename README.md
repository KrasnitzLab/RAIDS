# Accurate inference of genetic ancestry from cancer-derived molecular data #

The **_aicsPaper_** package enables accurate and robust inference of genetic ancestry from various types of molecular data, including whole-genome, whole-exome, targeted gene panels and RNA sequences, as described in our bioRxiv manuscript. Our tools retain high accuracy in presence of somatic alterations, such as those caused by cancer.

# This package will be available soon. #

## If you wish to be notified when the package is released, please send an e-mail with "AICS Paper" as the subject line to: pascal_belleau@hotmail.com
