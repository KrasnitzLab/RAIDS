\title{Generate a VCF with the information from the SNPs that pass
a cut-off threshold}
\usage{
snvListVCF(gds, fileOUT, offset = 0L, freqCutoff = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{gds}{an object of class
\code{\link[SNPRelate:SNPGDSFileClass]{SNPRelate::SNPGDSFileClass}}, a SNP
GDS file.}

\item{fileOUT}{a \code{character} string representing the path and file
name of the VCF file that will be created wit the retained SNP information.}

\item{offset}{a single \code{integer} that is added to the SNP position to
switch from 0-based to 1-based coordinate when needed (or reverse).
Default: \code{0L}.}

\item{freqCutoff}{a single positive \code{numeric} specifying the cut-off to
keep a SNP. If \code{NULL}, all SNPs are retained. Default: \code{NULL}.}
}
\value{
The integer \code{0} when successful.
}
\description{
This function extract the SNPs that pass a frequency cut-off
in at least one super population
from a GDS SNP information file and save the retained SNP information into
a VCF file.
