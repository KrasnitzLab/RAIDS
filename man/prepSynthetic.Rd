(study and sample information) into a GDS Sample file}

prepSynthetic(
  fileProfileGDS,
  listSampleRef,
  profileID,
  studyDF,
  nbSim = 1L,
  prefId = "",
  verbose = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{fileProfileGDS}{a \code{character} string representing the file name
of the GDS Sample file containing the information about the sample
used to generate the synthetic profiles.}

\item{listSampleRef}{a \code{vector} of \code{character} string
representing the
identifiers of the selected 1KG samples that will be used as reference to
generate the synthetic profiles.}

\item{profileID}{a \code{character} string TODO}

\item{studyDF}{a \code{data.frame} containing the information about the
study associated to the analysed sample(s). The \code{data.frame} must have
those 2 columns: "study.id" and "study.desc". Those 2 columns
must be in \code{character} strings (no factor). Other columns can be
present, such as "study.platform", but won't be used.}

\item{nbSim}{a single positive \code{integer} representing the number of
simulations per combination of sample and 1KG reference. Default: \code{1L}.}

\item{prefId}{a single \code{character} string representing the prefix that
is going to be added to the name of the synthetic profile. The prefix
enables the creation of multiple synthetic profile using the same
combination of sample and 1KG reference. Default: \code{""}.}

\item{verbose}{a \code{logical} indicating if messages should be printed
to show how the different steps in the function. Default: \code{FALSE}.}

\value{
\code{0L} when successful.

\description{
This function add entries related to synthetic profiles into
a GDS Sample file. The entries are related to two types of information:
the synthetic study and the synthetic profiles.

The study information is appended to the GDS Sample file "study.list" node.
The "study.platform" entry is always set to 'Synthetic'.

The profile information, for all selected synthetic profiles, is appended to
the GDS Sample file "study.annot" node. Both the "Source" and the
"Sample.Type" entries are always set to 'Synthetic'.

The synthetic samples are assigned unique names by combining :
[prefId].[data.id.profile].[listSampleRef].[simulation number(1 to nbSim)]
