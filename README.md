# Accurate inference of genetic ancestry from cancer-derived molecular data with **RAIDS** #

The Robust Ancestry Inference using Data Synthesis (**_RAIDS_**) package 
enables accurate and robust inference of genetic 
ancestry from various types of molecular data, including whole-genome, 
whole-exome, targeted gene panels and RNA sequences, as described in our 
bioRxiv manuscript. Our tools retain high accuracy in presence of somatic 
alterations, such as those caused by cancer.

**This code and analysis pipeline was designed and developed for the following publication:**
