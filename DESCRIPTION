Title: Accurate Inference of Genetic Ancestry from Cancer Sequencing
Description: This package implements specialized algorithms that enable
    genetic ancestry inference from various cancer sequencing sources (RNA,
    Exome and Whole-Genome sequencing). This package also implements a
    simulation algorithm that generates synthetic cancer-derived data. 
    This code and analysis pipeline was designed and developed for the
    following publication: Belleau, P et al. Accurate and robust inference of 
    genetic ancestry from cancer-derived molecular data across 
    genomic platforms. bioRxiv 2022.02.01.478737.
