The files in the examples extdata/demoGenoChr.tar
are for each chromosome the first 100 genotype of the profiles  NA12003, NA12004 and NA12005 extract from the 1KG VCF files from
 http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/data_collections/1000_genomes_project/release/20181203_biallelic_SNV

The files
tests/ex1_good_small_1KG.gd
tests/ex1_good_small_1KG_Annot.gds
are base on subset of the genotype from 1000 genomes describe in
https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/4-50/
500 SNV from each chromosome are used (11000 for the 22 autosomal chromosomes).
For each of the 26 sub continentales population in this version of 1000 genomes, 6 profiles are randomly selected (156 profiles) to generate those gds.



The files :
example/snpPileup/ex1.vcf.gz
example/snpPileup/ex1.generic.txt.gz
example/snpPileup/ex1.txt.gz
example/snpPileupRNA/ex1.generic.txt.gz
example/snpPileupRNA/ex1.txt.gz
demoAncestryCall/ex1.gds
demoKNNSynthetic/ex1.gds

The genotype are synthetic data between a profile in 1000 genome randomly selected with an AFR
ancestry and not in the sample used in tests/ex1_good_small_1KG.gd and one exome from Tiriac et al. 2018.
(the exome is restricted access, it is only use to get the total read deep at the SNV position
and an estimate of allelic fraction of the regions).
Only 500 SNVs per chromosome are kept.
The pipeline to generate the synthetic data are describe in Belleau et al 2023.

The files :
HG00*.csv.bz2
are the first 10 SNV from chromosome 1 in 1000 genomes describe in
https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/4-50/

The file :
matFreqSNV_Demo.txt.bz2
is the csv file with the frequency for the 5 super population of the 10 first SNV from
chromosome 1 in 1000 genomes describe in
https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/4-50/

The file:
listSNPIndexes_Demo.rds
mapSNVSelected_Demo.rds
are create from matFreqSNV_Demo.txt.bz2
listSNPIndexes_Demo.rds: is an index of the variant where the frequency of at
least one 1000 genomes superpopulation is bigger than 1%.
mapSNVSelected_Demo.rds: subset matFreqSNV_Demo.txt.bz2 of the SNV selected
in listSNPIndexes_Demo.rds

The file:
unrelatedPatientsInfo_Demo.rds
list of unrelated (the file does not represent real relation between) patient from 1000 genome describe in
https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/4-50/
