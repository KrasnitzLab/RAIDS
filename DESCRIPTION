Title: Accurate Inference of Genetic Ancestry from Cancer Sequencing
Description: This package implements specialized algorithms that enable
    genetic ancestry inference from various cancer sequencing sources (RNA,
    Exome and Whole-Genome sequencing). This package also implements a
    simulation algorithm that generates synthetic cancer-derived data.
