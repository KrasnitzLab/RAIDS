# Accurate inference of genetic ancestry from cancer-derived sequencing #

The **_aicsPaper_** package enables efficient ancestry inference from various cancer sequencing sources (exome, RNA, whole-genome). The package also implements simulation algorithm that generates synthetic cancer-derived data.

# This package will be available soon. #

## If you want to be notified when the code is released, send me an email with AICS Paper in the object: pascal_belleau@hotmail.com
