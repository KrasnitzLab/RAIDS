Title: Accurate Inference of Genetic Ancestry from Cancer Sequences
Description: This package implements specialized algorithms that enable
    genetic ancestry inference from various cancer sequences sources (RNA,
    Exome and Whole-Genome sequences). This package also implements a
    simulation algorithm that generates synthetic cancer-derived data. 
    This code and analysis pipeline was designed and developed for the
    following publication: Belleau, P et al. Genetic Ancestry Inference from 
    Cancer-Derived Molecular Data across Genomic and Transcriptomic 
    Platforms. Cancer Res 1 January 2023; 83 (1): 49–58.
