# Accurate inference of genetic ancestry from cancer-derived sequencing #

The **_aicsPaper_** package enables efficient ancestry inference from various cancer sequencing sources (exome, RNA, whole-genome). The package also implements simulation algorithm that generates synthetic cancer-derived data.

**This code and analysis pipeline was designed and developed for the following publication:**
